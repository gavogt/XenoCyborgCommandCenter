Assignment: Advanced Alien Cyborg Program Enhancements – main.c

Objective:
  Build a feature?rich, menu?driven C program to manage a dynamic roster of Alien Cyborgs.
  You will practice:
    • Dynamic memory allocation (malloc/realloc/free)
    • Structs, enums, and unions
    • Menu loops with multiple actions
    • Sorting with qsort and function pointers
    • Searching with predicates
    • Dual?format file I/O (text vs. binary)
    • Robust error handling and input validation

Requirements:

1. Data Model
   • In main.c, define:
       typedef enum { SCOUT, WARRIOR, ENGINEER, MEDIC } CyborgRole;
       typedef struct {
         int         id;
         char        name[50];
         int         age;
         CyborgRole  role;
       } AlienCyborg;
   • All operations in a single file using this struct.

2. Dynamic Roster Storage
   • Declare:
       AlienCyborg **roster = NULL;
       size_t count = 0, capacity = 0;
   • On start, allocate initial capacity (e.g. 4). On malloc failure, print perror and exit(1).

3. Growth Strategy
   • When count == capacity:
       – Double capacity (or set to 4 if zero)
       – realloc roster; on failure, free memory, perror, exit(1).

4. Startup Mode Selection
   • On launch, read argv[1] (filename) and prompt:
       “Load as (1) binary or (2) text format?”
   • Based on choice, load existing data:
       – Binary: fread count, then each struct.
       – Text: fscanf lines of “id,name,age,role”.
   • If file doesn’t exist, start empty.

5. Menu?Driven Loop (repeat until “6”)
       1) Add Alien Cyborg
       2) List All Cyborgs
       3) Search Cyborgs
       4) Sort Cyborgs
       5) Save & Exit
       6) Exit Without Saving
   • Read single-char choice; reject invalid inputs.

6. Add Alien Cyborg
   • Prompt for id, name (fgets + strip newline), age, role (0–3).
   • Before add, grow roster if needed.
   • Allocate new struct, fill fields, roster[count++] = ptr.

7. List All Cyborgs (with Age Categorization)
   • Loop through roster:
       – Print “[ID] Name (Age years – <category>) – ROLE”
         where <category> = “Minor” (<18), “Adult” (18–64), “Senior” (65+).
       – Convert enum to string via switch.

8. Search Cyborgs
   • Prompt: search by (a) ID or (b) Role.
     – For ID: read int, scan roster for matching id.
     – For Role: read 0–3, list all matching.
   • Print found entries with same format as “List.”

9. Sort Cyborgs
   • Prompt: sort by (a) ID or (b) Name.
   • Implement two compare functions and call:
       qsort(roster, count, sizeof(*roster), cmp_by_id);
     or
       qsort(roster, count, sizeof(*roster), cmp_by_name);

10. Save & Exit
   • Based on initial format choice, open file for “wb” or “w”.
   • Binary: fwrite count + structs.
   • Text: for each cyborg, fprintf “%d,%s,%d,%d\n”.
   • On any fopen/fwrite/fprintf error, perror and exit(1).
   • Free all allocated memory and exit(0).

11. Exit Without Saving
   • Free all memory and exit(0) without touching file.

12. Error Handling & Validation
   • Check return values of scanf/fgets/fread/fwrite/fprintf.
   • Clear stdin when mixing numeric and string inputs.

13. Documentation
   • At top of main.c, include author, date, file purpose.
   • Comment each major block: initialization, load, menu, add, list, search, sort, save, cleanup.

Stretch Goals (Optional):
  • Replace dynamic array with linked list.
  • Add a union for role?specific abilities in AlienCyborg.
  • Implement unit tests in a separate test.c.
  • Support CLI flags: -t (text), -b (binary), -n N (initial capacity).
